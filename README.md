# Predicting Corporate Bankruptcy Risk using Financial Ratios and Machine Learning

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for predicting corporate bankruptcy risk.  Using publicly available financial statement data, we analyze key financial ratios and leverage various machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. This model can assist investors and lenders in proactively assessing and managing credit risk. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and visualization of key findings.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key performance metrics of the trained model to the console, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `feature_importance.png`, `roc_curve.png`, `confusion_matrix.png`) which are saved in the designated output directory. These visualizations provide insights into the model's performance and the importance of different financial ratios in predicting bankruptcy.  The exact filenames and visualizations may vary depending on the model chosen and the specific analysis performed.
